Hey there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a human-shaped collection of caffeine, code, and curiosity.

By day: wrangling JavaScript, TypeScript, and React into submission.  
By night: chasing bugs, tennis balls, and sunsets. Not always in that order.  
Sometimes I store things in MySQL, occasionally I flirt with Java.  
HTML/CSS? You could say we have history.

I build things, break things, and then build them better.  
Nature enthusiast, photo capturer, meme appreciator.
